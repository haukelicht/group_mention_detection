# Social group mention detection with supervised learning

This repository contains the code and data for the paper "Detecting Group Mentions in Political Rhetoric: A Supervised Learning Approach" by Hauke Licht (hauke.licht@uibk.ac.at) and Ronja Sczepanski (ronja.sczepanski@sciencespo.fr) forthcoming in the *British Journal of Political Science*.

**Abstract**<br>
> Politicians appeal to social groups to court their electoral support. 
> However, quantifying which groups politicians refer to, claim to represent, or address in their public communication presents researchers with challenges. 
> We propose a supervised learning approach for extracting group mentions from political texts.
> We first collect human annotations to determine the passages of a text that refer to social groups.
> We then fine-tune a transformer language model for contextualized supervised classification at the word level.
> Applied to unlabeled texts, our approach enables researchers to automatically detect and extract word spans that contain group mentions.
> We illustrate our approach in two applications, generating new empirical insights into how British parties use social groups in their rhetoric.
> Our method allows detecting and extracting mentions of social groups from various sources of texts, creating new possibilities for empirical research in political science.
