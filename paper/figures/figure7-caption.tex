Coefficients estimates from logistic regressions analyzing whether sentences that contain group mentions are more likely to contain emotion words. The x-axis reports our estimates of the odds that a sentence contains emotional language when it contains at least one social group mention compared to when it contains no social group mention. Points (line ranges) report the coefficients point estimates (95\% confidence intervals) of logistic regression models. The y-axis values differentiate between different emotion dictionary categories. \label{fig:regression_coefficients}
