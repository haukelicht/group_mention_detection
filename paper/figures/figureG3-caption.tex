Summary of test set performances in annotated UK manifesto sentences in the Thau (2019) data of automatically expanded versions of the Dolinsky-Huber-Howe dictionary in terms of the word-level F1-score, precision, and recall. Values (vertical bars) report the average (90\% quantile range) of performances across 5 folds x-axis labels indicate how many ($k$) nearest neighbor terms per original keyword were included to expand the dictionary. \emph{Note:} \texttt{seqeval} is the strict metric proposed by \citet{ramshaw_text_1995} and implemented by \citet{nakayama_seqeval_2018}. \label{fig:dictionary_expansion_wordlevel_f1_by_k}
