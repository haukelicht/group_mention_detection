Cross validation of social group salience measures generated with our classifier against Dolinsky-Huber-Horne dictionary. Figure compares the share of sentences per manifesto that contain at least one social group mention according to our classifier to the share of sentences per manifesto that contain at least one group keyword recorded in the Dolinsky-Huber-Horne dictionary (y-axis). Colors indicate parties. Cases subset to those in Thau (2019) data for the sake of comparability. Correlation coefficient (with 95\% confidence interval) shown in top-left of plot panel. \label{fig:uk_manifestos_sg_salience_ours_vs_dhh}
