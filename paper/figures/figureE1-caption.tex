Summary of test set performances of RoBERTa group mention detection classifier fine-tuned and evaluated on corpus of labeled UK manifesto sentences as function of the training data size. The y-axis indicates the \texttt{seqeval} F1 score achieved. The x-axis indicates the number of sentences in the training set. Points (line ranges) report the average (90\% quantile range) of performances of 5 different classifiers fine-tuned with different random seeds. Colors distinguish between the micro performance and the social group mention category-specific performances. \emph{Note:} \texttt{seqeval} is the strict metric proposed by \citet{ramshaw_text_1995} and implemented by \citet{nakayama_seqeval_2018}. \label{fig:uk-manifestos_training-size_roberta-finetuning_testset_seqeval_f1}
