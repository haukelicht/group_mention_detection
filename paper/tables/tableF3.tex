\caption{\label{tab:uk-manifestos_roberta_missed_thau-spans_wordfreqs}Most frequent words in group-based appeals manually identified by \citet{thau_how_2019} our RoBERTa token classifier has not predicted to belong to a social group mention. One row per type of group according to Thau's categorization, focusing on those where our classifier perfroms relatively poorly in terms of the social group recall. \emph{Note:} Values in parentheses indicate the number of occurences in the relevant subset of Thau's data.}
