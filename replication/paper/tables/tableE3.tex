\caption{\label{tab:uk-manifestos_roberta_testset_sg_recall_by_span_length}Average mention-level social group mention recall in test set of RoBERTa group mention detection classifier fine-tuned and evaluated on corpus of labeled UK manifesto sentences by number of words in span. \emph{Notes:} Test-set spans grouped into bins based on the number of words they contain at the 50, 80, and 90\% percentile values. For example, bin (0, 2] contains social group mentions that span up to two words, bin (2, 6] mentions that span between three to six words, etc. Recall values in square brackets report the 90\% confidence intervall computed from bootstrapped values.}
