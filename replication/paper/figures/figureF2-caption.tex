Share of sentences in Labour and Conservative Party manifestos that contain at least one social group mention by election. \emph{Note:} To quantify the uncertainty in these estimates, we have bootstrapped sentence-level indicators. Points (vertical lines) report average (95\% confidence interval) of 100 bootsrapped estimates. \label{fig:lab_con_sg_salience_overtime}
