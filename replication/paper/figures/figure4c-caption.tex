Summary of test set performances of DeBERTa group mention detection classifiers in cross-domain transfer experiment. The y-axis indicates performance in terms of the \texttt{seqeval} F1 score of classifiers fine-tuned on annotated manifesto sentences from UK party manifestos and then evaluated on, and successively adapted to sentences from parties' speeches in the UK House of Commons. Points (line ranges) report the average ($\pm$\,1\,std.\,dev.) of performances of 5 different classifiers fine-tuned with different random seeds. Plot panels indicate whether the classifier was tested in the source domain (i.e., party manifestos, left) or the target domain (i.e., parliamentary speech, right). For the ``target'' panel, the x-axis reports whether the classifier fine-tuned on party manifesto sentences was evaluated without adapting it to the target texts (0, i.e., ``zero shot'') or, if not, how much labeled sentences were used to adapt the classifier (through continued training) befor evaluation. \emph{Note:} \texttt{seqeval} is the strict metric proposed by \citet{ramshaw_text_1995} and implemented by \citet{nakayama_seqeval_2018}. \label{fig:uk_cross-domain-transfer_deberta-finetuning_testset}
