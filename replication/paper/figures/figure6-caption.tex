Comparisons of different pairs of parties in terms of the words and phrases that distinguish the social groups the mention in their manifestos for the elections 2015, 2017, and 2019. \emph{Note:} $z$-scores indicate words ``distinctiveness'' and have been obtained by applying the ``fightin' words'' method proposed by \citet{monroe_fightin_2008} to the social group mentions retrieved by our classifier. \label{fig:uk_manifestos_sg_fighting_words}
