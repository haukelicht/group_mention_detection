Cross validation of RoBERTa group mention detection classifier's predictions against data collected by \citet{thau_how_2019}. Figure compares the numbers of social group mentions identified in a manifesto by \citet[see x-axis]{thau_how_2019} and our classifier (y-axis) in Labour and Conservative party manifestos (1964-2015). Colors indicate parties. Correlation coefficient (with 95\% confidence interval) shown in top-left of plot panel. \label{fig:uk_manifestos_sg_counts_cross_validation}
