5002,1987,con,Sometimes they work in very difficult conditions,3,Health,Health
5003,1987,con,That is why the Government has reduced nurses' basic hours from 40 to 37 1/2 hours per week and increased their pay by 30 per cent after allowing for inflation,3,Health,Health
5004,1987,con,We will continue to improve the Health Service,3,Health,Health
5005,1987,con,Future Tasks for the Health Service,3,Health,Health
5006,1987,con,Our policies rest on six principles:,3,Health,Health
5007,1987,con,"First, we will give greater emphasis to the prevention of avoidable illness and the promotion of good health to make the NHS more truly a health service and not merely a sickness service",3,Health,Health
5008,1987,con,Much progress has been made in the past eight years,3,Health,Health
5009,1987,con,· The improvement of the maternity services has helped to reduce by a third the death rate among babies in the weeks around birth,3,Health,Health
5010,1987,con,· The expansion of vaccination and immunisation has prevented illness and death among children,3,Health,Health
5011,1987,con,· Screening for cervical cancer has been improved and death rates from the disease have fallen by almost 10 per cent in the past decade,3,Health,Health
5012,1987,con,· We have already embarked on a major campaign to tackle the problem of coronary heart disease,3,Health,Health
5013,1987,con,"· To fight AIDS, the Government has undertaken the biggest health education campaign ever seen in this country one much admired abroad and is fully supporting the Medical Research Council in a special programme of research towards treatments and vaccines",3,Health,Health
5014,1987,con,These are welcome advances,3,Health,Health
5015,1987,con,"In the next Parliament, we will build on this work by:",3,Health,Health
5016,1987,con,· completing the network of computerised 'call and recall' systems for cervical cancer screening,3,Health,Health

5018,1987,con,· developing a national programme for breast cancer screening;,3,Health,Health
5019,1987,con,· backing the newly established and powerful Health Education Authority,3,Health,Health
5020,1987,con,"Second, we will continue to show our support for the million people working in the NHS, of whom half are nurses",3,Health,Health
5021,1987,con,"Nurses wanted the assurance that, without recourse to strike action, they would receive fair treatment over pay",3,Health,Health
5022,1987,con,That is why we set up the independent Nurses' Pay Review Body,3,Health,Health
5023,1987,con,"After the latest award, we will have increased nurses' pay by 30 per cent since 1979, after allowing for inflation",3,Health,Health
5024,1987,con,"That compares to the severe reduction of more than 20 per cent, which they suffered under the last Labour Government",3,Health,Health
5025,1987,con,"Nurses also want a training and career structure which reinforces their professionalism, rewards experience, and offers opportunities for managerial responsibility without being removed to a distant desk",3,Health,Health
5026,1987,con,"We share those views, and will seek to further them",3,Health,Health
5027,1987,con,"We are particularly keen to attract experienced nurses back into the profession, and to encourage others to take up nursing as a new career",3,Health,Health
5028,1987,con,"Hospital doctors and consultants, too, are a vital part of the Health Service",3,Health,Health
5029,1987,con,We have already increased the number of consultant posts and we will continue to work for improvements in the medical career structure,3,Health,Health
5030,1987,con,The NHS could not function without ancillary services,3,Health,Health
5031,1987,con,"Some of these cleaning, catering, and laundry have been put out to competitive tender to enable health authorities to select the best and most effective way of providing these services",3,Health,Health
5032,1987,con,Savings are now approaching £100 million a year and they have gone directly and immediately into better patient care,3,Health,Health
5033,1987,con,We have undertaken consultation on the improvement of primary care,3,Health,Health
5034,1987,con,"Our aim is to develop the strength and flexibility of the services provided by GPs, dentists, pharmacists, opticians and nurses who work in the community",3,Health,Health
5035,1987,con,There are particular problems affecting health care in inner cities,3,Health,Health
5036,1987,con,Doctors and nurses there take on a particularly tough and difficult job,3,Health,Health
5037,1987,con,"We shall continue to look for new ways of helping them and improving health care, especially primary care in the inner cities",3,Health,Health
5038,1987,con,"Our third principle is to modernise the whole framework of the health service its hospitals, its clinics, its equipment",3,Health,Health
5039,1987,con,"In the face of economic collapse, the last Labour Government cut the hospital building programme by a third",3,Health,Health
5040,1987,con,This Government has embarked on the biggest building programme ever,3,Health,Health
5041,1987,con,It will cost £3 billion,3,Health,Health
5042,1987,con,In seven years we have already carried through over 200 major building projects from start to finish,3,Health,Health
5043,1987,con,"We will complete some 125 further major new building schemes in the next three years, and get many more under way",3,Health,Health
5044,1987,con,"New hospitals, too, are being built in areas lacking the provision they need",3,Health,Health
5045,1987,con,Old and inefficient Victorian buildings are being replaced with purpose-built modern hospitals,3,Health,Health
5046,1987,con,"Much modern medicine and surgery is better carried out in the new larger hospitals, equipped with new medical technology",3,Health,Health
5047,1987,con,"Wherever possible, however, small old hospitals have found a new role as community hospitals staffed by local GPs",3,Health,Health
5048,1987,con,"Fourth, elderly, disabled, mentally ill and mentally handicapped people, should be cared for within the community whenever this is right for them",3,Health,Health
5049,1987,con,"In the past some people who should have been cared for in other ways have remained in hospitals, sometimes for years",3,Health,Health
5050,1987,con,That is changing,3,Health,Health
5051,1987,con,The number of children in long-stay hospitals for the mentally handicapped has fallen by almost three-quarters,3,Health,Health
5052,1987,con,The number of adults in long-stay mental handicap and mental illness hospitals has fallen by around 11 000,3,Health,Health
5053,1987,con,This changing pattern has already brought a better life to many thousands of people,3,Health,Health
5054,1987,con,It has the potential to do so for many thousands more,3,Health,Health
5055,1987,con,But we need to examine carefully various alternatives to discover what is now best for patients,3,Health,Health
5056,1987,con,We have set in hand the first ever full-scale review of community care,3,Health,Health
5057,1987,con,We will develop our policies in the light of its findings,3,Health,Health
5058,1987,con,Our fifth principle is to strengthen management,3,Health,Health
5059,1987,con,The NHS is a large and complex organisation,3,Health,Health
5060,1987,con,It needs good management,3,Health,Health
5061,1987,con,"It is not a business, but it must be run in a business-like way",3,Health,Health
5062,1987,con,The reduction of waste and inefficiency has released hundreds of millions of pounds for better patient care,3,Health,Health
5063,1987,con,"The sale of property which the NHS no longer needs - for example, because of new hospital developments is currently raising £200 million a year for better health care",3,Health,Health
5064,1987,con,We will continue to ensure that the Health Service is as efficient as possible,3,Health,Health
5065,1987,con,But good management is not just a matter of efficiency,3,Health,Health
5066,1987,con,We value enterprise in the public service just as much as in the private sector,3,Health,Health
5067,1987,con,We will continue to encourage district and regional managers to devise new ways of providing better patient care,3,Health,Health
5068,1987,con,"Finally, the ultimate purpose of the Health Service is to serve the patient: that principle is at the heart of the Government's policy",3,Health,Health
5069,1987,con,The time some patients have to wait for treatment is the most widespread concern in the NHS,3,Health,Health
5070,1987,con,The Government has given priority to reducing waiting lists and times,3,Health,Health
5071,1987,con,We have set up a special £50 million two-year programme,3,Health,Health

5073,1987,con,"We have set targets for more hip operations for old people, and more bone marrow transplants for children",3,Health,Health
5074,1987,con,Putting patients first was the theme of our consultative document on primary care,3,Health,Health
5075,1987,con,We want the patient to have more information about services available from family doctors so that they can make a more informed choice,3,Health,Health
